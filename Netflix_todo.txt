What do I want to be able to do with this app?

As a user, I would like to be able to ...

SAVE A SHOW! :

Press "save" on a show detail to store that show onto firebase for later viewing.
Press "save" on a list of results to save that list onto firebase for later viewing.

SPIN THE WHEEL! :

Press "random show" to play roulette with those values. 
	This could most likely be easily done, by generating the list and instantly going to the appropriate page.
